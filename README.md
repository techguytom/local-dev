### A Local Home Page for OSX Web Development

Current Version 0.3

This is the home page for my personal development environment. It was
originally based off of work found within this [blog post](http://mallinson.ca/post/osx-web-development).

The landing page from that post has been rewritten in
[Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org) for my own use.
